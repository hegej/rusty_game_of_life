# ü¶Ä Conway's Game of Life in Rust

Welcome to **Conway's Game of Life** implemented in Rust! This project simulates the classic cellular automaton developed by mathematician John Conway, showcasing Rust‚Äôs performance and memory safety. 


## üßê About
Conway's Game of Life is a grid-based simulation where cells live, die, or reproduce based on a few simple rules. This project is written in Rust for optimal performance and leverages Rust's memory management to handle large simulations efficiently.
